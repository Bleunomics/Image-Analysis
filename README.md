# A Nuclei Image Analysis Survey

**Introduction:** Currently, we want to focus on the tagging of Nuclei images as well as its slicing, in order to allow us to figure out certain patterns computationally. These patterns will then be inputted into a [GAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) in order to create similar images and replications. We hope the results will help us look into developing tools in the field of biomolecular geometry.
